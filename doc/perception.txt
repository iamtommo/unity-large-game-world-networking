perception system exists so that the server can keep track of what clients have seen.
from that we can derive what we need to send, and therefore only send actors and data which has changed.


interface contract:
- get tick where the client last saw actor A
- get generation where the client last saw actor A

input contract:
- when we send data to client, tell perception system that we send data for actor A at tick T.
- when we rcv client input, tell perception system client saw tick T.

and nothing else.

--NOTE
unfortunately we need to keep track of actor generations we send to clients too.
perhaps there's another solution but i can't think of one atm.
