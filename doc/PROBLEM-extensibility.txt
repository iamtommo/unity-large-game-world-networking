current implementation is very explicit.
explicit is good but its very hard to test without having explicit tests for each case.

ideally the system would be atleast minorly generic.
but which parts of the system?
perception system is concise - doesn't even need the concept of extensibility.

world packing kinda needs to be explicit for datagroups like motor[pos,rot,vel,jump,crouch,etc]
rn all packing happens sequentially in a single system, explicitly --- not good

the essential role of the replication system is to tell the programmer exactly what needs to be sent to the client
and anything further than that becomes a different problem, i.e. encoding and sending data over the network.

culling/sorting/MTU probably should be seperate and happen after we've asked the rep system what to do
